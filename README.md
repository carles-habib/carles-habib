- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new app with react that helps the user discover new places and gamify the process with a minimal clean look
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and some javaScript
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with switching between stacks as I am a laravel full-stack web developer and was thinking about switching to nodejs and adding some react to my code so tell me what is your thought about this ? 
- 📫 How to reach me: on my social links like my IG or linkedin
